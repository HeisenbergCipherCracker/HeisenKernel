 *		identical to _softexpires.
 * @_softexpires: the absolute earliest expiry time of the hrtimer.
 *		The time which was given as expiry time when the timer
 *		was armed.
 * @function:	timer expiry callback function
 * @base:	pointer to the timer base (per cpu and per clock)
 * @state:	state information (See bit values above)
 * @is_rel:	Set if the timer was armed relative
 * @is_soft:	Set if hrtimer will be expired in soft interrupt context.
 * @is_hard:	Set if hrtimer will be expired in hard interrupt context
 *		even on RT.
 *
 * The hrtimer structure must be initialized by hrtimer_init()
